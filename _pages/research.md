This study explores **anisotropic optical behavior** in few-layer **rhenium disulfide (ReSâ‚‚)**.  
The intrinsic in-plane structural anisotropy allows the coexistence of **metallic and dielectric responses** along orthogonal directions, leading to **hyperbolic plasmon modes**. We demonstrate that ReSâ‚‚ naturally supports these plasmons in the **ultraviolet frequency range**, and that the tunability of this regime depends on the **number of layers**, opening pathways for **hyperbolic photonics applications**.

This paper investigates the superconducting properties of a two-dimensional s-wave superconductor on a kagome lattice subjected to **correlated disorder**. Using the **Bogoliubovâ€“de Gennes (BdG)** formalism, we analyze how disorder correlations affect the superconducting order parameter and derive the corresponding **superfluid stiffness**.  
A key finding is the **bimodal distribution** of the pairing amplitude at strong correlation strengths, revealing how spatially correlated disorder reshapes superconducting behavior and highlights the crucial role of lattice geometry.

This work models **population migration** and its impact on the spread of infectious diseases during and after **punctuated lockdowns**.  
The model describes **multi-city migration**, computes the **basic reproduction number**, and examines how migration rates influence outbreak dynamics. Repeated lockdown cycles produce **damped oscillatory infection patterns**, offering insights into optimizing lockdown timing and intensity.

[[ðŸ“„ Article]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjp%2Fs13360-020-00766-1) Â· [[ðŸ§  arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13489)

We propose a mathematical model analyzing tumor and normal cell dynamics under the influence of **inorganic arsenic** and an **immunomodulator (black tea)**.  
The study shows that incorporating a **variable immune-cell influx** offers significant improvement over constant modelsâ€”reducing tumor populations while maintaining healthy cell levels. Analytical stability analysis and numerical simulations reveal how immune modulation can mitigate cancer growth **without chemotherapeutic side effects**.
